# Stock Prediction by LSTM


Predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This Jupyter Notebook project utilizes deep learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Overview

Stock Prediction by LSTM employs LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in historical stock prices. The model is trained on historical data and makes predictions for future stock prices.

## Key Features

- **LSTM Networks**: Utilizes the power of Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequence prediction.
- **Historical Data**: Makes predictions based on historical stock prices.
- **Deep Learning**: Leverages deep learning techniques to capture intricate patterns.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook for ease of use.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
 git clone https://github.com/Thanujashree/codealpha_Stock-Prediction.git

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
- Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed: `pip install notebook`
- Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
- Open the `stock-prediction-lstm.ipynb` file in the browser.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
- Execute the cells in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Usage

- Modify the notebook to experiment with different hyperparameters and settings.
- Analyze the model's predictions and performance.
- Understand the LSTM-based stock prediction process.
